This is a set of retro computer.
This set includes :
+ Monitor with separate screen mesh and material
+ Desktop computer
+ 2 types of keyboards (medium and low polygon)

A screen texture is divided by 4, and I made 4 materials for examples.
In Standard shader "px2_monitor_screen 1", as you can see 'Offset' options are : x 1.5 / y 0. and the screen shows old DOS screen.
